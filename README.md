Introduction:
In this software development project, I will be creating a comprehensive Student Information System (SIS) with a user-friendly web interface using Angular(Front End) Dotnet Core(API) MySql(Database). I focus on code modularity and reusability, implement robust validation and exception handling, and utilize Angular routing for seamless navigation. Our database design will include primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints.
