# School Information System - Software Development Project

##Introduction
Welcome to the Student Information System (SIS) software development project! In this endeavor, we aim to create a comprehensive and user-friendly Student Information System that leverages modern technologies for both the front end and back end. The key components of our system include:

Front End: We will be using Angular, a popular web application framework, to develop an intuitive and interactive user interface. Angular will allow us to create a dynamic and responsive user experience.

Back End: Our API will be built using Dotnet Core, a powerful and cross-platform framework. Dotnet Core provides robust support for building scalable and performant APIs.

Database: We will be utilizing MySql as our database management system to store and manage student information efficiently. Our database design will incorporate best practices, including primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints, to ensure data integrity.
