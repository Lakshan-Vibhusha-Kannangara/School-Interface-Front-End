# Introduction

Welcome to the Student Information System (SIS) software development project! In this endeavor, we aim to create a comprehensive and user-friendly Student Information System that leverages modern technologies for both the front end and back end. The key components of our system include:

Front End: I'm using Angular framework to develop an intuitive and interactive user interface. A dynamic and responsive user experience.

Back End: The Web API will be built using Dotnet Core

Database: I'm utilizing MySql as our database management system to store and manage student information efficiently. Our database design will incorporate best practices, including primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints, to ensure data integrity.
